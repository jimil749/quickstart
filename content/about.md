Hey there! How you doin'? I am **Jimil Desai**, currently a Computer Science undergrad at School of Engineering and Applied Science, Ahmeadabad University pursuing my bachelors degree in **Information and Communication Technology**. I am passionate about software development and engineering, especially in the fields of **distributed systems**, **full stack development** and **Cloud Computing**. I love working on large scale open source technologies, particularly in **Cloud Native**(Technologies around Kubernetes) and try to contribute regularly. I am proficient at multiple languages including **Golang, C/C++, JavaScript and MySQL**, and have worked with technologies such as **Git, BASH, Docker, Kubernetes, MongoDB, Latex and gRPC**.

Apart from Coding and Open Source, I love Swimming and to play basketball. As a matter of fact, I have been a state level competitor in both of the sports! I am also big on Movies and TV shows! :p
